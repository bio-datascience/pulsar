Description: An implementation of the Stability Approach to
    Regularization Selection (StARS, H. Liu - 2010), with options for speedups,
    paralellizations and alternate/complementary metrics (notably, graphlet
    stability). Intended for L1-regularized graphical
    models (e.g. glasso or Meinshausen-Buhlmann neighborhood selection), using your
    favorite implementation (i.e. huge, QUIC, etc). The method is quite generic (via
    function passing) and could be used for Lasso-type problems as well.
