Description: An implementation of the Stability Approach to Regularization Selection (StARS, H. Liu - 2010), with options for speedups, paraellizations and alternative stability metrics. This package is particulaly intended for L1-regularized graphical models (glasso or Meinshausen-Buhlmann neighborhood selection), using your favorite implementation (i.e. huge, QUIC, glmnet, etc) though the method is quite generic (via function passing) and could be used for Lasso-type problems as well. 
    In batch computing systems, we use the BatchJobs Map/Reduce strategy (for batch computing systems like Torque, LSF, SLURM or SGE) which can significantly reduce the computation and memory burdens for StARS, even compared to multicore/parallelized implementations. 
    Additionally, this package contains options for using a heuristic lower bound on lambda, that works well in practice when the dimensionality is high (above 20 variables or so). Thus, computational burden is reduced when many subsamples are required.
